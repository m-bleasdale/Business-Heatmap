# Business Location Heatmap

[https://business-heatmap.vercel.app/](url)

This tool overlays the locations of all businesses registered with the UK Food Standards Agency onto a map. The density of businesses can be visualised using a heatmap.

Two modes are available:

- Heatmap - the recommended way to view the data. Shows the location and geographical density of businesses.

- Points - each business is shown on the map with a single point.

This tool can be used to very quickly see urban city-centers, culture hubs, etc.

The region and business type can also be configured.
